# Design Review

## Design Objectives
The design aims to develop a robust machine learning model for anomaly detection in timeseries datasets. The objectives include data preprocessing, anomaly detection, scoring, and visualization to ensure effective anomaly management. The design appears to meet the stated requirements and business goals by providing a comprehensive solution for anomaly detection and visualization.

## Architecture & Components
The architecture is well-structured with clear modular components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects and stores timeseries data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes data.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Applies machine learning models to detect anomalies.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualizes detected anomalies.
5. **User Interface**: Provides an interactive dashboard for users.

Each module has a clear responsibility, making the design modular and maintainable.

## Data Flow & Interfaces
The data flow is logical and efficient:
1. Data is ingested from external sources.
2. Preprocessed to clean and normalize.
3. Anomaly detection models are applied.
4. Detected anomalies are visualized.
5. Users interact with the dashboard.

The API contracts and data flows are clear, ensuring efficient communication between components.

## Technology Choices
The selected technologies are appropriate and aligned with industry standards:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Frameworks**: React, Dash, TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **Tools**: Apache Kafka, Plotly, D3.js.

These technologies are well-suited for the tasks and provide scalability and performance.

## Scalability & Performance
The design considers scalability and performance:
- **Scalability**: Use of Apache Kafka for distributed data processing ensures the system can handle large volumes of data.
- **Performance**: Optimization of machine learning models and data processing pipelines for efficient anomaly detection.

The design should handle expected load and future growth effectively.

## Security & Compliance
The design addresses security measures and compliance requirements:
- **Authentication**: User authentication to ensure authorized access.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to restrict access based on user roles.
- **Data Protection**: Data encryption in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.

These measures ensure the system is secure and compliant with data protection standards.

## Error Handling & Logging
The design should consider failure scenarios and observability:
- Implement comprehensive error handling to manage and log errors effectively.
- Ensure logging mechanisms are in place to monitor system performance and detect issues.

This will improve the system's reliability and maintainability.

## Assumptions & Risks
### Assumptions:
- Timeseries data is available and accessible from external sources.
- Users have necessary permissions to access the dashboard.

### Risks:
- Dependency on the quality and completeness of collected data.
- Performance and scalability limitations of chosen technologies and frameworks.

Identifying these assumptions and risks helps in planning mitigation strategies.

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Error Handling & Logging**: Ensure comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented to improve system reliability.
2. **Scalability**: Consider additional strategies for scaling machine learning models, such as distributed training and inference.
3. **User Interface**: Enhance the user interface with more interactive features and customization options for better user experience.
4. **Security**: Regularly update security measures to address emerging threats and ensure compliance with the latest standards.
